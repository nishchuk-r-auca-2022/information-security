# To change file owner and group, we should execute following commands:

# To change file owner:
ls -la file.txt
# -rw-r--r--  1 user1 usergroup  1024 Jan 28 12:00 file.txt

sudo chown newuser file.txt

# To change group
sudo chgrp newgroup file.txt

# To change file owner and group at the same time:
sudo chown newuser:newgroup file.txt



How it affects to file usage:

If the file owner is changed using chown:

The new owner gains full control over the file permissions.
The previous owner loses control unless they still have access through a group or global permissions.
If the group is changed using chgrp:

Members of the new group can access the file according to the assigned permissions.
Members of the old group may lose access if they are no longer part of the new group.
If the owner does not have permissions:

Even the file owner cannot modify or execute the file if they do not have rw- or x permissions.
